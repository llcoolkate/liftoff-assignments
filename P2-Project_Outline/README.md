## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project is an comprehensive hub of information for cat lovers, cat owners, and future cat owners. It is a field guide for cat culture. It will include local information on cat adoption, cat shelters, cat cafe's, cat supply stores, and vets. We will have FAQs for new cat parents, and a symptom checker for those weird situations when you need to know if you should go to the cat hospital or if their cat behavior is nothing to worry about. There will be some diversions for humans including cat videos and general cat breed history/information. There will be a forum / message board for community questions and suggestions for helpful features. Users will be able to track their cat's health using their profile page where they can upload pictures of their furbabies and keep all their cat's information uptodate in one location.
