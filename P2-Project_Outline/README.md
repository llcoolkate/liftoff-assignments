## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project is an comprehensive hub of information for cat lovers, cat owners, and future cat owners. It is a field guide for cat culture. It will include local information on cat adoption, cat shelters, cat cafe's, cat supply stores, and vets. We will have FAQs for new cat parents, and a symptom checker for those weird situations when you need to know if you should go to the cat hospital or if their cat behavior is nothing to worry about. There will be some diversions for humans including cat videos and general cat breed history/information. There will be a forum / message board for community questions and suggestions for helpful features. Users will be able to track their cat's health using their profile page where they can upload pictures of their furbabies and keep all their cat's information uptodate in one location. 
### Features
User login: users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page. 
Search for local adoptable pets: users will be able to search for local adoptable pets currently available from licensed cat shelters. Users will be able to sort their search results by age. 
Cat video generator: clicking on the random cat video generator will bring up a random cat video from a repository of appropriate and adorable cat videos. 
Cat message boards: this will be a simple searchable message board where people can ask for recommendations from the local cat community
